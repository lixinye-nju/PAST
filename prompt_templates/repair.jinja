{{ code1 }}
```

### Translated Code
```{{ lang2 }}

```

### Execution feedback
{{ error_message }}

{{ diff }}


We are trying to translate {{ lang1 }} code to {{ lang2}} and get above feedback.
Your task is to compare the {{ lang1 }} and {{ lang2 }} version code and find out the mistake in {{ lang2 }}. 
Let's analyze the feedback, then output the modified code in the end.


Notes
1. Do not add more debugging prints in the code.
2. Think about the syntactic and semantic differences between two languages. 
3. Devil is in the details.
